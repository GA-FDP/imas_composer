# Claude Context for DIIID_IMAS Project

## Data Privacy and Testing Policy

**IMPORTANT**: This project works with restricted DIII-D fusion data that is NOT publicly accessible.

### Testing Restrictions for AI Assistants:
- **NEVER run pytest or any test commands** that would fetch real MDS+ data
- **NEVER execute Python code** that calls `mdsvalue()` or connects to DIII-D databases
- **NEVER run any integration tests** without explicit user permission for each execution
- The user will run all tests locally - they have appropriate data access credentials

### Why:
- Running tests would expose restricted fusion research data to the AI assistant
- Data access is controlled and requires proper authorization
- All data remains on user's local machine with proper access controls

### What you CAN do:
- Write test code and test fixtures
- Review and suggest improvements to test structure
- Help debug test failures by reading error messages/logs provided by user
- Modify source code and test files
- Use static analysis tools that don't execute code

### What you CANNOT do:
- Execute any command that fetches MDS+ data
- Run pytest on tests that use real data
- Run Python scripts that import `omas.mdsvalue` and execute queries
- Background process any data-fetching operations

**If the user asks you to run tests**: Politely remind them of this policy and ask for explicit confirmation that the specific test run does not access restricted data.
