# Static values for DIII-D Thomson Scattering IDS
# These are hardcoded values not available in MDSplus
# Source: OMAS d3d.py::thomson_scattering_data

# Thomson scattering currently has no static hardcoded values
# All data comes from MDSplus ELECTRONS tree

# Notes:
# - If static values are added in the future, they should follow IMAS schema naming
# - Broadcasting to channel arrays happens in synthesis phase based on number of channels
