# Static values for DIII-D ECE IDS
# These are hardcoded values not available in MDSplus
# Source: OMAS d3d.py::electron_cyclotron_emission_data

# IDS properties
ids_properties.homogeneous_time: 0  # ECE does not have homogeneous time across all channels

# Line of sight endpoints (not in MDSplus - hardcoded geometry)
# These represent the viewing geometry of the ECE system
line_of_sight.first_point.r: 2.5   # meters - outer position
line_of_sight.second_point.r: 0.8  # meters - inner position

# Notes:
# - first_point and second_point phi and z are derived from MDSplus data (ECEPHI, ECETHETA, ECEZH)
# - These R values define the radial extent of the line of sight through the plasma
# - Broadcasting to channel arrays happens in synthesis phase based on number of channels
